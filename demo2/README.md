# Advance Java Course June 2020
 # Demo 2

 This is a tiny demo that uses spring boot to creat an MVC.
 Spring Initializer https://start.spring.io/ can be used to create the framework. 

 You will need a Model in src/main/java/model (or java/com/deloitte/training/demo2/model).
 This is simply the definition of the object with all of the getter and setter functions.
 This looks like this Name.java.

 You will need a services file, which gives the path names, I think that this is the View.
 This lives in  src/main/java/services (or java/com/deloitte/training/demo2/services).
 And its name is NameServices.java.

 You will need an Application file, which I presume is the controller.
 It lives in src/main/java (or java/com/deloitte/training/demo2).
 It is called DemoApplication.java presumably it can use different models.
